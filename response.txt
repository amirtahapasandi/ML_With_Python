The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This effect is named after the British scientist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the 19th century.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Composition of Sunlight**: Sunlight, or white light, is composed of various colors, each with different wavelengths. The visible spectrum includes red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

2. **Interaction with the Atmosphere**: As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters air molecules, water droplets, and dust particles. Blue light has a shorter wavelength (and higher energy) compared to other visible colors in sunlight, such as red.

3. **Rayleigh Scattering**: Because blue light has a shorter wavelength, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere much more than other colors with longer wavelengths like red and yellow. This scattered blue light is what we see from any direction we look in the sky.

4. **Why Not Purple?**: While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are less sensitive to violet. Additionally, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, and thus blue light dominates what we perceive.

During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on shades of red, orange, and pink. This happens because the sunlight path through the atmosphere is longer at these times of day. The blue light is scattered out of the line of sight, and the longer wavelengths like red and orange are less affected by scattering, thereby dominating the sky's color.

In summary, the scattering of shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) by the molecules in the atmosphere makes the sky appear blue to our eyes.
